ICS3U - Final Culminating Task

Description:
This is a checkers game that I made and I worked alone. 

From original design, I included all the functionalities except animation, because as you said during the initial check, it is not necessary as the checkers still seamlessly move to the correct location without it and would be redundant.

In terms of extra functionalities, I added an option to select who goes first, instead of only having red go first, in the main menu. This makes the game more customizable and gives the player more options. Additional jumps are now optional and you can click the x on the side screen to cancel the jump. This once again improves the game experience because it gives the player's the option to not use forced jumps. In the case of a player being unable to make any more moves, I included a forfeit button on the side screen so if a player runs out of moves, they press the button and the other player wins. This also improves the game experience because it prevents a tie and is fair to the person who should win in this case; this is something that I did not consider in the initial proposal. The stats screen now has a reset button to reset the statistics in the text file. This is an improvement to the statistics screen in case the player wants to restart the stats. There are many improvements to the graphics and the actual checkerboard/checker pieces.

There are no known bugs or errors.

In order to play the game, simply click the checker piece you want to move. If there are white indicators, it means it is selected. Click the square to move the piece. If it is valid, the turn goes to the opponent. However, if you made a jump and there are additional jumps, the piece you just moved will be indicated. If you do not want to make the jump, click the x on the side menu. If you cannot make any moves, click forfeit.
